# Tutorial: snowflake-s3compat-api-test-suite

This project is a **test suite** designed by Snowflake to help storage vendors verify that their systems are *compatible with Amazon S3*. By running a series of automated checks, it validates that essential API functions work correctly and also measures their performance. Successfully passing these tests is a key step for ensuring a storage system can be integrated with the **Snowflake Data Cloud**.
