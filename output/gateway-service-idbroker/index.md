# Tutorial: gateway-service-idbroker

The Identity Broker service acts as a secure **middleman** between a user and a cloud provider (like *AWS*, *Azure*, or *GCP*).
After a user authenticates, this service automatically determines which cloud *role* they are allowed to use based on their username or group memberships. It then generates and returns temporary, short-lived credentials, enhancing security by avoiding the need to distribute long-term cloud access keys to users.
