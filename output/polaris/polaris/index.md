# Tutorial: polaris

Polaris is a centralized, universal metadata service that acts as a single source of truth for various data table formats like *Iceberg* and *Delta Lake*. It provides a **REST API** for clients, such as Apache Spark, to discover and manage data assets. A core feature is its robust security model, which includes *authentication* and fine-grained *authorization* to control data access. Polaris is designed for multi-tenancy using **Realms**, which are isolated environments for different teams or organizations. It also supports advanced governance through **Policies** for managing the data lifecycle and can act as a unified gateway to other existing catalogs via **Catalog Federation**.
