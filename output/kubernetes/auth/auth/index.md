# Tutorial: auth

This project provides an *authorization* system for Kubernetes using **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**. It works like a security guard checking a list of rules to decide if a request is allowed. These rules, called *policies*, are loaded from a simple text file, making it easy to configure who can access what resources. The project also includes a specialized component to specifically identify requests coming from cluster *nodes* (like Kubelets), ensuring they only get the permissions they need.
