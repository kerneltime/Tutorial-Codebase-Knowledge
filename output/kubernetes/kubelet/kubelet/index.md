# Tutorial: kubelet

The Kubelet is the *main agent* running on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. Its primary responsibility is to make sure that *containers are running in a Pod* as expected. It acts as the local "manager" on the node, taking instructions from the central Kubernetes control plane. The Kubelet handles everything from **starting and stopping containers** using a container runtime (like containerd), **attaching storage volumes**, managing **CPU and memory resources**, and regularly **checking if containers are healthy**. It also reports the status of the pods and the node itself back to the main Kubernetes API server, so the cluster always knows what's happening on each machine.
