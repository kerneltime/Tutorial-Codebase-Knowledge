# Tutorial: asciinema

`asciinema` is a command-line tool that lets you **record** your terminal sessions and share them with others. Instead of creating heavy video files, it captures everything as lightweight, text-based *asciicast* files. These recordings can be perfectly replayed in a terminal or used for *live streaming* your command-line work in real-time. The modern version of the tool is built using **Rust** for high performance and reliability.
