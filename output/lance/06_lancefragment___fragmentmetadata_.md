# Chapter 6: LanceFragment & FragmentMetadata - The Building Blocks of Your Dataset

Welcome to Chapter 6! In [Chapter 5: Vector Indexing - Your Super-Fast Similarity Search Tool](05_vector_indexing_.md), we saw how Lance can speed up vector searches using sophisticated indexes. These indexes, and indeed all the data in your Lance dataset, are organized into smaller, more manageable pieces. This chapter dives into these fundamental building blocks: **`LanceFragment`** and **`FragmentMetadata`**.

## Why Break Data into Pieces? The "Book and Chapters" Analogy

Imagine you have an enormous encyclopedia with millions of pages. If it were just one single, gigantic volume, finding specific information or even just moving the book around would be a nightmare! Instead, encyclopedias are usually divided into multiple volumes, and each volume into chapters. This makes them much easier to handle, search, and manage.

A Lance dataset works on a similar principle. Instead of storing all your data (which could be gigabytes or terabytes) in one monolithic file, Lance breaks it down into smaller, more manageable chunks called **fragments**.

*   **`LanceFragment`**: Think of this as a "chapter" in your dataset "book". It represents an actual, physical segment of your data rows.
*   **`FragmentMetadata`**: This is like the table of contents or summary for each "chapter". It doesn't contain the data itself, but it describes what's in the fragment:
    *   How many rows it originally contained (`physical_rows`).
    *   Where the actual data files for this fragment are stored (`files`).
    *   Information about any rows within this fragment that have been marked as deleted (`deletion_file`).
    *   A unique ID for the fragment.

Why is this fragmentation useful?
1.  **Efficiency for Large Datasets**: Operations can sometimes be localized to specific fragments. For example, if a query only needs data that exists in a few fragments, Lance doesn't need to scan the entire dataset.
2.  **Parallel Processing**: Operations like writing data or building indexes can potentially be parallelized across multiple fragments.
3.  **Incremental Updates**: When data is added or deleted, Lance can often create new fragments or update the metadata of existing ones without rewriting the entire dataset. This is key for efficient updates and versioning.

## Peeking Inside: Accessing Fragments and Their Metadata

When you work with a [LanceDataset](03_lancedataset_.md), you can easily access its fragments and inspect their metadata. Let's use the `my_products_indexed.lance` dataset we prepared in Chapter 5. (If you don't have it, running the setup code from Chapter 5 will create it).

```python
import lance
import pandas as pd

# Path to the dataset (created in Chapter 5)
dataset_path = "my_products_indexed.lance"

# 1. Open the LanceDataset
try:
    dataset = lance.dataset(dataset_path)
    print(f"Successfully opened dataset: {dataset.uri}\n")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Could not open dataset at '{dataset_path}'.")
    print(f"Please ensure you've run the code from Chapter 5 to create it.")
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    exit()

# 2. Get all fragments in the dataset
fragments = dataset.get_fragments()
print(f"Dataset contains {len(fragments)} fragment(s).")

# 3. Let's inspect the metadata of the first fragment
if fragments:
    first_fragment = fragments[0] # This is a LanceFragment object
    metadata = first_fragment.metadata # Access its FragmentMetadata

    print(f"\n--- Metadata for Fragment ID: {metadata.id} ---")
    print(f"  Number of physical rows: {metadata.physical_rows}")
    print(f"  Number of deleted rows: {metadata.num_deletions}")
    print(f"  Effective number of rows: {metadata.num_rows}") # physical_rows - num_deletions

    print("\n  Data files in this fragment:")
    for data_file in metadata.files: # metadata.files is a list of DataFile objects
        print(f"    - Path: {data_file.path}") # Path relative to the dataset's data directory
        print(f"      Field IDs stored: {data_file.fields}") # Internal Lance field IDs
        # print(f"      File size (bytes): {data_file.file_size_bytes}") # May not always be populated

    # You can also get a specific fragment by its ID
    # fragment_id_to_get = 0 # Assuming fragment 0 exists
    # specific_fragment = dataset.get_fragment(fragment_id_to_get)
    # print(f"\nSuccessfully retrieved fragment with ID: {specific_fragment.fragment_id}")

else:
    print("Dataset has no fragments to inspect.")
```

**Explanation:**
1.  We open our Lance dataset.
2.  `dataset.get_fragments()`: This method returns a list of `LanceFragment` objects. Each object in this list represents one fragment (or "chapter") of your dataset.
3.  `first_fragment = fragments[0]`: We grab the first `LanceFragment` from the list.
4.  `metadata = first_fragment.metadata`: Each `LanceFragment` object has a `metadata` attribute, which is an instance of `FragmentMetadata`. This `metadata` object holds all the descriptive information about the fragment.
5.  We then print out various properties of the `FragmentMetadata`:
    *   `metadata.id`: The unique identifier for this fragment.
    *   `metadata.physical_rows`: The total number of rows initially written to this fragment's data files.
    *   `metadata.num_deletions`: The number of rows within this fragment that are marked as deleted. Lance often handles deletions by marking rows rather than immediately rewriting files.
    *   `metadata.num_rows`: The "live" number of rows in the fragment (physical minus deleted).
    *   `metadata.files`: This is a list of `DataFile` objects. A single fragment's data might be stored across one or more physical files, especially if the fragment is large or if different sets of columns are stored separately (a more advanced scenario). Each `DataFile` object tells you:
        *   `data_file.path`: The path to the actual `.lance` data file (usually relative to a `_data` subdirectory within your dataset directory).
        *   `data_file.fields`: A list of internal Lance Field IDs indicating which columns of your schema are stored in this particular data file.

**Expected Output (will vary slightly based on your data from Chapter 5, especially if you re-ran it):**
```
Successfully opened dataset: my_products_indexed.lance

Dataset contains 1 fragment(s).

--- Metadata for Fragment ID: 0 ---
  Number of physical rows: 5
  Number of deleted rows: 0
  Effective number of rows: 5

  Data files in this fragment:
    - Path: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000-0.lance  # Filename will be a UUID + count
      Field IDs stored: [0, 1, 2, 3]

```
*Note: If your dataset was written in multiple appends, or if it's very large and `lance.write_dataset` decided to split it, you might see more than one fragment.*

Each `LanceFragment` object is not just a container for metadata; it's also a "mini-dataset" itself. You can perform operations like `scanner()` or `take()` directly on a `LanceFragment` if you want to work only with the data within that specific fragment.

```python
# (Continuing from the previous script)

if fragments:
    print(f"\n--- Reading data from Fragment ID: {first_fragment.fragment_id} ---")
    # You can scan just this fragment
    fragment_data_table = first_fragment.scanner(limit=2).to_table()
    print("First 2 rows from this fragment:")
    print(fragment_data_table.to_pandas())
```
**Expected Output:**
```
--- Reading data from Fragment ID: 0 ---
First 2 rows from this fragment:
   product_id      name    price  description_embedding
0           1  Laptop X  1200.50     [0.xx, 0.yy, 0.zz, 0.aa]
1           2   Mouse Y    25.00     [0.bb, 0.cc, 0.dd, 0.ee]
```

## How Lance Organizes Fragments Under the Hood

When you write data to a Lance dataset (e.g., using `lance.write_dataset()` as in [Chapter 2: Data Ingestion / Write Operations](02_data_ingestion___write_operations_.md)), Lance handles the fragmentation automatically.

1.  **Data Writing & Fragmentation**: As data is written, Lance groups rows into fragments. The size of these fragments can be influenced by parameters like `max_rows_per_file` or `max_bytes_per_file` (especially if using lower-level APIs like `lance.write_fragments`). For each fragment, Lance writes one or more `.lance` data files into a `_data` subdirectory within your main dataset directory (e.g., `my_products_indexed.lance/_data/`).
2.  **Metadata Creation**: For each fragment created, a `FragmentMetadata` record is generated. This record captures the fragment's ID, the paths to its data files, the number of rows, etc.
3.  **Manifest Update**: All these `FragmentMetadata` records are listed in the dataset's **manifest file** (e.g., `my_products_indexed.lance/_latest.manifest`). The manifest file is like the master index for your dataset, telling Lance which fragments exist for a particular version of the dataset and where to find their descriptions.

When you open a `LanceDataset` using `lance.dataset(uri)`:
*   Lance reads the manifest file.
*   It parses the list of `FragmentMetadata` entries from the manifest.
*   This information allows the `LanceDataset` object to know about all its constituent fragments.

    participant User
    participant Dataset as LanceDataset
    participant ManifestFile as "_latest.manifest (in dataset_dir)"
    participant PyFragmentMetadata as "FragmentMetadata (Python object)"
    participant PyDataFile as "DataFile (Python object)"
    participant PhysicalDataFiles as "Actual .lance files in _data/"

    User->>Dataset: lance.dataset("my_dataset.lance")
    Dataset->>ManifestFile: Reads manifest
    ManifestFile-->>Dataset: Contains list of serialized FragmentMetadata (JSON-like)

    loop For each fragment entry in manifest
        Dataset->>Dataset: Deserializes entry into PyFragmentMetadata
        PyFragmentMetadata->>PyFragmentMetadata: Stores ID, physical_rows, deletion_info
        PyFragmentMetadata->>PyDataFile: Creates DataFile objects for each file_path listed
    end
    Note over Dataset: Dataset now knows all its fragments and their metadata.

    User->>Dataset: frags = dataset.get_fragments()
    Dataset-->>User: List of LanceFragment objects (each wrapping its PyFragmentMetadata)

    User->>LanceFragment: data = frag.scanner().to_table()
    LanceFragment->>PyFragmentMetadata: What are my data files?
    PyFragmentMetadata-->>LanceFragment: List of PyDataFile objects
    LanceFragment->>PhysicalDataFiles: Reads data from paths specified in PyDataFile (e.g., "_data/uuid-0.lance")
    PhysicalDataFiles-->>LanceFragment: Data rows
    LanceFragment-->>User: Arrow Table
end
```
This diagram shows that the manifest file is key. It stores the *description* of each fragment. The actual row data resides in separate `.lance` files within the `_data` directory.

### Diving into the Code (Python & Java Structures)

The structures `FragmentMetadata` and `DataFile` are fundamental.

**In Python** (from `python/python/lance/fragment.py`):
These are implemented as Python dataclasses, making them easy to work with.

```python
# Simplified representation of the Python dataclasses:

# from dataclasses import dataclass, field
# from typing import List, Optional
# from lance.lance import DeletionFile # This is a Rust-bound class

# @dataclass
# class DataFile:
#     _path: str  # Path to the actual data file
#     fields: List[int] # List of field IDs stored in this file
#     # ... other attributes like version, file_size_bytes ...
#
#     @property
#     def path(self) -> str:
#         return self._path

# @dataclass
# class FragmentMetadata:
#     id: int
#     files: List[DataFile] # List of DataFile objects
#     physical_rows: int
#     deletion_file: Optional[DeletionFile] = None # Info about deleted rows
#     # ... other attributes like row_id_meta ...
#
#     @property
#     def num_deletions(self) -> int:
#         # ... calculates deletions ...
#         return 0 # Simplified
#
#     @property
#     def num_rows(self) -> int:
#         return self.physical_rows - self.num_deletions
```
The `LanceFragment` class (also in `python/python/lance/fragment.py`) acts as a Python wrapper around an internal Rust fragment object. It provides methods like `scanner()`, `count_rows()`, `metadata`, etc., for that specific fragment.

**In Java** (primarily from `java/core/src/main/java/com/lancedb/lance/FragmentMetadata.java` and `java/core/src/main/java/com/lancedb/lance/fragment/DataFile.java`):
You'll find corresponding Java classes.

*   `com.lancedb.lance.FragmentMetadata`: Holds similar information to its Python counterpart (ID, list of `DataFile`s, physical rows, `DeletionFile`).
    ```java
    // Conceptual structure of Java's FragmentMetadata
    // package com.lancedb.lance;
    // import com.lancedb.lance.fragment.DataFile;
    // import com.lancedb.lance.fragment.DeletionFile;
    // import java.util.List;

    // public class FragmentMetadata implements Serializable {
    //     private int id;
    //     private List<DataFile> files;
    //     private long physicalRows;
    //     private DeletionFile deletionFile;
    //     // ... constructors, getters ...
    // }
    ```
*   `com.lancedb.lance.fragment.DataFile`: Describes a single data file within a fragment, including its path and the field IDs it contains.
    ```java
    // Conceptual structure of Java's DataFile
    // package com.lancedb.lance.fragment;
    // import java.util.List;

    // public class DataFile implements Serializable {
    //     private String path; // Note: in Python it's _path
    //     private List<Integer> fields;
    //     // ... other attributes, constructors, getters ...
    // }
    ```
*   The `com.lancedb.lance.Fragment` class (in `java/core/src/main/java/com/lancedb/lance/Fragment.java`) provides methods to interact with a specific fragment, like creating a `LanceScanner` for just that fragment.

Understanding that `FragmentMetadata` simply *describes* a chunk of data, and that `DataFile` points to where that data *lives*, is key to grasping how Lance manages datasets.

## Conclusion

You've now explored `LanceFragment` and `FragmentMetadata`, the fundamental building blocks that Lance uses to organize your data on disk. You've learned:
*   Why datasets are broken into fragments (efficiency, parallelism, incremental updates).
*   How `FragmentMetadata` describes each fragment (ID, row counts, data file locations, deletion info).
*   How to access `LanceFragment` objects from a `LanceDataset` and inspect their metadata in Python.
*   That each `LanceFragment` can be scanned independently.
*   A high-level view of how fragments are created during writes and how their metadata is stored in the dataset's manifest.

These fragments and their metadata are crucial for many of Lance's advanced features, including efficient querying, versioning, and data compaction.

While `FragmentMetadata` tells us *which* data files belong to a fragment, what's inside those actual `.lance` data files? And how can we work with them at an even lower level if needed? We'll touch on this in our next chapter, [Lance File Reader/Writer](07_lance_file_reader_writer_.md).
