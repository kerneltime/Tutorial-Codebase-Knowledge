# Tutorial: directpv

DirectPV is a storage solution for Kubernetes that lets you use *local disks* on cluster nodes for persistent storage. It works by introducing new Kubernetes resources, called **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**, to represent physical drives and logical volumes. An automated *controller* system watches these resources, and when a user requests storage, it finds a suitable disk, formats it with the **XFS filesystem**, and makes it available to applications. All management is done through a `kubectl` plugin, giving administrators full control.
