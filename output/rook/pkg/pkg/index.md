# Tutorial: pkg

This project is the brain of the **Rook Ceph operator**, which automatically manages Ceph storage clusters inside Kubernetes.
You tell it *what kind of storage you want* by creating simple configuration files (called **Custom Resources**).
The operator's controllers then read your request and do all the hard work: they set up the core Ceph components, provision storage disks (OSDs), and make sure everything keeps running as you defined it.
