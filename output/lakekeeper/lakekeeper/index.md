# Tutorial: lakekeeper

Lakekeeper is a server that acts as a central **metadata catalog** for *Apache Iceberg* tables. Think of it as a library's card catalog for your data lake; it tracks information about your data tables, but doesn't store the actual data itself. It provides robust security by controlling *who* can access both the metadata and the underlying data through **pluggable authentication** and **fine-grained authorization**. The entire service is designed to be easily deployed and managed as a lightweight **container** in modern cloud environments.
