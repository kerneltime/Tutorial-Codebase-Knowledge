# Chapter 6: Deployment as a Containerized Service

In the [previous chapter on Storage Access Management](05_storage_access_management_.md), we completed our tour of Lakekeeper's core features. We now have a complete picture of a secure, multi-tenant data catalog. We know how it manages metadata, isolates teams, authenticates users, authorizes actions, and even secures access to the underlying data files.

But having a great blueprint for a service isn't enough. How do you actually build it and run it? In a modern cloud world, deploying software can be complicated. You have to worry about operating systems, system libraries, dependencies, and making sure it runs the same way on your laptop as it does in a massive production environment.

### The Problem: The Complicated Assembly Kit

Imagine you just bought a new, high-tech piece of furniture. But instead of a finished product, you receive a box with hundreds of tiny parts, a bag of assorted screws, and a manual written in a language you don't understand. Building it would be a nightmare, and there's no guarantee your finished product would be stable.

Deploying traditional software can feel a lot like this. It's a complex, error-prone assembly process.

### The Solution: A Pre-Fabricated Appliance

Lakekeeper is designed to avoid this complexity entirely. It's not a kit of parts; it's a **self-contained, pre-fabricated appliance**.

Think of it like buying a new microwave. You don't need to solder the circuits or build the casing yourself. You receive a complete, sealed unit. All you have to do is:
1.  Place it where you want it.
2.  Plug it into a power source (a database).
3.  Configure a few settings on the front panel (environment variables).

That's it. It's ready to go.

Lakekeeper achieves this simplicity by being a **containerized service**. It is built and distributed as a lightweight **Docker container**. This single container packages the Lakekeeper application and everything it needs to run, ensuring it behaves identically everywhereâ€”from your laptop to a cloud server.

### How to Run the Appliance: Docker Compose

For local development and testing, the easiest way to run Lakekeeper is with Docker Compose. It's a tool that lets you define and run multi-container applications with a single command. The Lakekeeper project provides a `docker-compose.yaml` file that sets up a complete working environment.

Let's look at a simplified version of this file to see how it works.

```yaml
# A simplified docker-compose.yaml
services:
  # The PostgreSQL Database (our "power outlet")
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready"]

  # The Lakekeeper application itself (our "appliance")
  lakekeeper:
    image: quay.io/lakekeeper/catalog:latest-main
    ports:
      - "8181:8181"
    environment:
      # This tells Lakekeeper how to connect to the database
      - LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
```

This simple file defines two services:
1.  `db`: A standard PostgreSQL database container. This is the "power outlet" that Lakekeeper needs to store its catalog metadata. The `healthcheck` tells Docker to make sure the database is running properly before other services depend on it.
2.  `lakekeeper`: This is the core Lakekeeper appliance.
    *   `image`: It pulls the official, pre-built Lakekeeper container from a public registry.
    *   `ports`: It connects port `8181` on your computer to port `8181` inside the container, so you can talk to the Lakekeeper API.
    *   `environment`: This is how we configure Lakekeeper! Here, we're giving it the connection string for the `db` service. Notice how we use the service name `db` as the hostname. Docker Compose handles the networking automatically.
    *   `depends_on`: This tells Docker Compose to wait until the `db` service is healthy before starting the `lakekeeper` service.

To start this entire stack, you navigate to the directory with the `docker-compose.yaml` file and run one simple command:

```sh
docker compose up
```
This command reads the file, downloads the necessary images, and starts all the services in the correct order. In seconds, you have a fully functional Lakekeeper instance running on your machine, ready to receive API calls.

### A Look Under the Hood: The Dockerfile

How is this magical, self-contained appliance built? The recipe is defined in a file called a `Dockerfile`. It contains the step-by-step instructions for packaging the Lakekeeper application.

While the actual `Dockerfile` in the project is optimized for caching and speed, its logic can be simplified to two main stages.

**Stage 1: Build the Binary**
Because Lakekeeper is written in Rust, the first step is to compile the source code into a single, efficient executable file.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: The "Workshop"
FROM rust:1.87-slim-bookworm AS builder

# Copy the source code into the container
COPY . .

# Compile the code into a single, optimized binary
RUN cargo build --release --bin lakekeeper
```
This stage uses a larger container that has the Rust compiler and all the necessary tools. It produces a single file, `/target/release/lakekeeper`, which is our entire application.

**Stage 2: Package the Appliance**
Now, we create the final, lightweight container. We don't need the compiler anymore; we just need the binary we just built.

```dockerfile
# Stage 2: The "Final Product"
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot

# Copy JUST the compiled binary from the "workshop" stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/lakekeeper /home/nonroot/lakekeeper

# Set the command to run when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT ["/home/nonroot/lakekeeper"]
```
This is the clever part. We start from a `distroless` base image. This is a super-minimal, secure image from Google that contains *nothing* except the absolute bare minimum libraries needed to run a program. There's no shell, no package manager, not even `ls` or `cat`. This makes the final container incredibly small and secure.

We then copy our single `lakekeeper` binary into this minimal image and set it as the entrypoint. The result is a tiny, secure, and efficient container that does one thing and one thing only: run the Lakekeeper service.

This process is visualized below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Source Code] --> B{Build Container (with Rust Compiler)};
    B --> C[Single 'lakekeeper' Binary];
    C --> D{Final 'distroless' Container};
    subgraph "Dockerfile"
        B
        D
    end
    D --> E[Ready-to-run Docker Image];
```

### From Local to Production: Helm for Kubernetes

While Docker Compose is perfect for local development, you need a more robust tool for production deployments. Lakekeeper is designed for cloud-native environments and provides a **Helm chart** for easy deployment on **Kubernetes**.

Helm is like a package manager for Kubernetes. The Lakekeeper Helm chart is a pre-configured set of templates that makes it simple to deploy, scale, and manage Lakekeeper in a production cluster, handling things like networking, storage, and configuration in a battle-tested way. This ensures the same "it just works" experience scales from your laptop to the cloud.

### Conclusion

You've now learned how Lakekeeper is designed for modern, cloud-native deployment. It's not a complex kit of parts but a simple, self-contained appliance distributed as a lightweight and secure Docker container. Its configuration is managed through standard environment variables, and it's easy to run locally with Docker Compose or in production with a Helm chart for Kubernetes.

This approach simplifies operations, enhances security, and ensures your data catalog runs reliably and consistently across all environments.

So far, we've treated Lakekeeper as a complete, sealed appliance. But what if you need to customize its behavior? What if you want to swap out its authorization engine or add a new type of storage backend? Lakekeeper is powerful because it's also designed to be opened up and modified in a safe way.

In our final chapter, we'll explore the advanced concept of [Extensibility via Traits](07_extensibility_via_traits_.md), which allows developers to plug their own custom logic directly into Lakekeeper's core.
