# Tutorial: db

This project is a high-performance, embeddable key-value database, similar to a supercharged dictionary that stores data on disk. It's designed to handle very large amounts of data efficiently. When you write data, it first goes into a fast, in-memory table called a **MemTable** and is also recorded in a **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** to prevent data loss. Later, these in-memory tables are *flushed* to disk as permanent, sorted files. A background process called **compaction** continuously organizes these files to ensure reads remain fast and to reclaim space. The database supports grouping data into **Column Families**, much like tables, and uses a powerful **versioning** system to provide consistent, point-in-time views of your data.
