# Chapter 3: Codebase Fetching & Filtering

In [Chapter 2: Tutorial Generation Flow](02_tutorial_generation_flow_.md), we learned about the assembly line plan that guides our tutorial creation. Now, let's look at the very first station on that line: gathering the raw materials! Before we can explain a codebase, we need to actually *get* the code. But we don't just want *all* the code; we want the *relevant* code.

This is where **Codebase Fetching & Filtering** comes in.

## What's the Problem? Code Overload!

Imagine you want to learn about a big, complex project like a web browser or a game engine. These projects can have thousands of files! Some are core source code, but many others might be:

*   Test files (important for developers, but maybe not for a beginner's first look).
*   Documentation files (useful, but we're generating our *own* tutorial).
*   Build scripts (code to compile or package the project).
*   Image files, data files, configuration files.
*   Temporary files or files related to version control (like `.git`).

If we tried to analyze *everything*, it would take a long time, cost more (if using AI services), and the resulting tutorial might be confusing, focusing on unimportant details.

**Analogy: The Helpful Librarian**

Think of this step like talking to a librarian. You don't just say "Give me all the books!" You say, "I'm researching modern Python web frameworks. Please find relevant books, but exclude dictionaries and books older than 5 years."

Our **Codebase Fetching & Filtering** step acts like that helpful librarian for code. It needs to:

1.  **Fetch:** Go get the books (code) from the right shelf (GitHub or your local computer).
2.  **Filter:** Select only the books (files) that match your criteria (include patterns, exclude patterns, size limits).

## Key Concepts: Fetching and Filtering

Let's break down how our "librarian" works:

**1. Fetching: Where's the Code?**

Our tool needs to know where the source code lives. You tell it using command-line arguments (like we saw in [Chapter 1](01_entry_point___configuration_.md)):

*   `--repo <URL>`: Tells the tool the code is on GitHub at the specified URL. It will then download the code from there. (e.g., `--repo https://github.com/psf/requests`)
*   `--dir <PATH>`: Tells the tool the code is already on your computer in the specified folder path. (e.g., `--dir ./my_project_code`)

You must provide *one* of these options.

*(Self-Correction: The original prompt's chapter 1 example command used `--repo`, matching this explanation.)*

**2. Filtering: Selecting the Right Files**

Once the tool knows *where* the code is, it needs to decide *which* files to keep. It uses three types of filters, also configured via command-line arguments or sensible defaults set in `main.py`:

*   **Include Patterns (`--include`):** These are like saying, "Only bring me files ending in `.py` or `.js`." They use wildcard patterns (like `*.py`) to specify which file types or names are likely to be important source code. If you don't specify any `--include` arguments, the tool uses a default list (`DEFAULT_INCLUDE_PATTERNS` from `main.py`) covering common code extensions.

    ```python
    # File: main.py (Defaults)
    DEFAULT_INCLUDE_PATTERNS = {
        "*.py", "*.js", "*.java", "*.md", # Python, Javascript, Java, Markdown
        # ... many other common code file extensions ...
    }
    ```

*   **Exclude Patterns (`--exclude`):** These are like saying, "Ignore anything in the `tests` folder or any file named `test_*.py`." They use patterns to specify files or directories that should *not* be included, even if they match an include pattern. Again, if you don't provide `--exclude`, defaults (`DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS`) are used to ignore common test, documentation, and build folders.

    ```python
    # File: main.py (Defaults)
    DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = {
        "*test*", "tests/*", "docs/*", # Test files, documentation
        ".git/*", "node_modules/*",    # Git data, dependency folders
        # ... other common things to ignore ...
    }
    ```

*   **Maximum File Size (`--max-size`):** This is like saying, "Don't bring me any single file larger than 100 Kilobytes." This helps exclude unusually large files that might be data, logs, or compiled libraries rather than human-readable source code. It defaults to a reasonable size (e.g., 100KB).

**How it Connects to `main.py` and `shared`**

Remember the `shared` dictionary from Chapter 1? It's the backpack carrying all our settings. The `main.py` script takes your command-line arguments (or uses defaults) for `--repo`, `--dir`, `--include`, `--exclude`, and `--max-size` and puts them neatly into `shared`.

```python
# File: main.py (Simplified shared dictionary creation)

shared = {
    "repo_url": args.repo, # e.g., "https://github.com/psf/requests" or None
    "local_dir": args.dir,  # e.g., "./my_project_code" or None
    # ... other settings ...

    # Use user-provided patterns OR the defaults
    "include_patterns": set(args.include) if args.include else DEFAULT_INCLUDE_PATTERNS,
    "exclude_patterns": set(args.exclude) if args.exclude else DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS,
    "max_file_size": args.max_size, # e.g., 100000

    # Placeholders for results - FetchRepo will fill "files"
    "files": [],
    # ... other placeholders ...
}
```

This `shared` dictionary is then passed along the assembly line to the first node responsible for fetching and filtering.

## Inside the Machine: The `FetchRepo` Node

The specific station on our assembly line responsible for this task is called the `FetchRepo` node (defined in `nodes.py`). Let's see how it works:

**1. Preparation (`prep` method):**

The first thing `FetchRepo` does is look inside the `shared` backpack it received. It pulls out the necessary settings: the repository URL or local directory path, the include/exclude patterns, the max file size, and the GitHub token (if needed).

```python
# File: nodes.py (Simplified FetchRepo.prep)

class FetchRepo(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        # Get source location
        repo_url = shared.get("repo_url")
        local_dir = shared.get("local_dir")

        # Get filters
        include_patterns = shared["include_patterns"]
        exclude_patterns = shared["exclude_patterns"]
        max_file_size = shared["max_file_size"]

        # Get token if needed for GitHub
        token = shared.get("github_token")

        # Return these settings for the next step (exec)
        return {
            "repo_url": repo_url,
            "local_dir": local_dir,
            "token": token,
            "include_patterns": include_patterns,
            "exclude_patterns": exclude_patterns,
            "max_file_size": max_file_size,
            # ... other details ...
        }
```

**2. Execution (`exec` method):**

This is where the actual fetching and filtering happens. Based on whether a `repo_url` or `local_dir` was provided, it calls a specialized helper function:

*   If `repo_url` exists: It calls `crawl_github_files`, passing the URL, token, and all the filter criteria. This helper handles connecting to GitHub, downloading files, checking them against include/exclude patterns, and verifying their size.
*   If `local_dir` exists: It calls `crawl_local_files`, passing the directory path and filter criteria. This helper scans the local folder, applying the same filtering logic.

```python
# File: nodes.py (Simplified FetchRepo.exec)

# (Inside FetchRepo class)
    def exec(self, prep_res): # 'prep_res' has the settings from prep()
        if prep_res["repo_url"]:
            print(f"Crawling repository: {prep_res['repo_url']}...")
            # Call helper for GitHub
            result = crawl_github_files(
                repo_url=prep_res["repo_url"],
                token=prep_res["token"],
                include_patterns=prep_res["include_patterns"],
                exclude_patterns=prep_res["exclude_patterns"],
                max_file_size=prep_res["max_file_size"],
                # ... other args ...
            )
        else:
            print(f"Crawling directory: {prep_res['local_dir']}...")
            # Call helper for Local Directory
            result = crawl_local_files(
                directory=prep_res["local_dir"],
                include_patterns=prep_res["include_patterns"],
                exclude_patterns=prep_res["exclude_patterns"],
                max_file_size=prep_res["max_file_size"],
                # ... other args ...
            )

        # The 'result' contains a dictionary like {"files": {"path/to/file.py": "content...", ...}}
        # Convert it to a list of (path, content) pairs
        files_list = list(result.get("files", {}).items())
        print(f"Fetched {len(files_list)} relevant files.")
        return files_list # Return the list of filtered files
```

*(Note: We don't need to look inside `crawl_github_files` or `crawl_local_files`. Just know they are the specialists doing the heavy lifting based on the instructions from `FetchRepo`.)*

**3. Storing Results (`post` method):**

After `exec` finishes and returns the `files_list` (containing only the relevant file paths and their content), the `post` method takes this list and puts it back into the `shared` dictionary under the key `"files"`.

```python
# File: nodes.py (Simplified FetchRepo.post)

# (Inside FetchRepo class)
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        # 'exec_res' is the files_list returned by exec()
        shared["files"] = exec_res # Update the shared backpack
```

Now, the `shared` dictionary contains the actual code content we need, ready for the next step in the assembly line!

**Visualizing the Process:**

Here's a simple flowchart showing the decision and filtering:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start FetchRepo Node] --> B{Repo URL or Local Dir?};
    B -- Repo URL --> C[Call crawl_github_files];
    B -- Local Dir --> D[Call crawl_local_files];
    C --> E{Apply Filters};
    D --> E;
    E -- Include Patterns --> F[Keep Matching Files];
    F -- Exclude Patterns --> G[Remove Matching Files];
    G -- Max Size --> H[Remove Too-Large Files];
    H --> I[Store Results in shared["files"]];
    I --> J[End FetchRepo Node];
```

## Conclusion

The **Codebase Fetching & Filtering** step is the essential starting point for understanding any codebase. Like a careful librarian, it fetches the code from its source (GitHub or local disk) and intelligently filters it based on your specified include/exclude patterns and file size limits. This ensures that only the most relevant source files are passed along for analysis.

The `FetchRepo` node orchestrates this by reading settings from the `shared` dictionary, calling the appropriate helper function (`crawl_github_files` or `crawl_local_files`), and storing the resulting list of file paths and content back into `shared["files"]`.

Now that we have our curated collection of code files, what's next? We need to start making sense of them!
