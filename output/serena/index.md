# Tutorial: serena

Serena is a **free and open-source coding agent** that connects powerful *Large Language Models (LLMs)* directly to your local codebase. Instead of the LLM just seeing text, Serena acts as a smart assistant, providing it with a toolbox of *semantic code understanding and editing capabilities*. By integrating with standard **Language Servers** (the same technology that powers IDEs), Serena allows the LLM to perform complex tasks like finding symbol definitions, locating all usages of a function, and performing precise code edits, turning any LLM into a sophisticated, project-aware developer.
