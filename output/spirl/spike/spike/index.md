# Tutorial: spike

SPIKE is a secure vault for managing your application's secrets, like passwords and API keys. It's built on a "zero-trust" principle, where every part of the system has a cryptographic passport (*a SPIFFE ID*) and must prove its identity before communicating. The main vault, **Nexus**, protects secrets using a master key that is so important it's split into pieces using *Shamir's Secret Sharing*. These pieces are held by trusted **Keepers**, ensuring that even if the main vault restarts, it can securely recover by reassembling the key from the Keepers. Administrators use a secure remote control, **Pilot**, to manage secrets and access rules.
