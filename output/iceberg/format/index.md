# Tutorial: format

This project defines a collection of standardized formats for managing and securing data assets in a large-scale data ecosystem. It introduces the **Iceberg View**, a *portable recipe* for virtual tables that can be shared across different query engines, complete with built-in versioning. To accelerate queries, it specifies the **Puffin File Format**, a container for auxiliary performance data like statistics and indexes. Finally, it provides the **AES GCM Stream Format**, a critical security layer that encrypts and tamper-proofs any file, protecting these metadata formats that lack native encryption.
