# Tutorial: delta-lake

This project provides a tool to **migrate** a *Delta Lake* table into an *Apache Iceberg* table.
It works by taking a "snapshot" of the entire Delta table, including its full version history, and recreating it as a new Iceberg table. The entire process is **transactional**, ensuring the migration either succeeds completely or fails without leaving a partially created table. This allows users to safely and reliably convert their data from one modern table format to another.
