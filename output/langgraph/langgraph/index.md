# Tutorial: langgraph

**LangGraph** is a library for building powerful, stateful applications with LLMs, such as agents and chatbots. It lets you define your application's logic as a *graph*, where each step is a *node* and the connections between them are *edges*.

The core idea is a shared **state** that acts as the application's memory. As the graph runs, nodes can read from and write to this state, allowing for complex, multi-step reasoning. LangGraph manages the entire execution flow, supports saving and loading the state for *persistence* (so agents can be long-running), enables easy *tool use*, and allows for *human-in-the-loop* interruptions.
