# Chapter 6: Hive Actor

In our [previous chapter on Data Sharing](05_data_sharing_.md), we saw how our catalog can securely provide temporary access to the physical data files. We've covered the entire journey of a request from the web down to the data access layer. But there's one crucial piece of the puzzle we've overlooked: how do we *actually* talk to the Hive Metastore (HMS) itself?

All our components, like the [HMS Catalog Adapter](03_hms_catalog_adapter_.md), have been delegating to a catalog object. This chapter introduces the **Hive Actor**, the lowest-level component that is the final link in the chain—the one that speaks directly to the Hive Metastore.

### The Problem: We Need a Specialist for the Old Machinery

Imagine our data library has a very old, complex, and powerful card catalog machine in the basement. This machine (the Hive Metastore) holds the official record for every book in the library. However, it doesn't have a simple keyboard or screen. It operates using a series of specific levers, dials, and a special language (the Thrift protocol).

A regular librarian can't just walk up and use it. They need a specialist technician who is an expert in operating this machine. The librarian can give the technician a simple request like, "Find the record for the book 'Moby Dick'," and the technician will handle all the complex machine operations to retrieve it.

The `HiveActor` is this specialist technician. It knows exactly how to "operate the machine"—how to speak the Thrift protocol to communicate with the Hive Metastore and perform actions like creating, reading, or deleting metadata.

### Meet the Hive Actor: The HMS Technician

The `HiveActor` is an abstraction whose main job is to hide the complexity of communicating with the Hive Metastore. It provides simple, clean methods like `getTable()` or `createDatabase()`. Behind the scenes, it handles all the messy details:

1.  **Managing Connections**: It efficiently manages network connections to the HMS so we don't have to open a new one for every single request.
2.  **Speaking Thrift**: It translates a simple Java method call into a low-level Thrift API call that the HMS understands.
3.  **Error Handling**: It deals with network errors and other low-level exceptions.

The primary implementation we use is the `HMSCatalogActor`. It's the bridge between the high-level Iceberg catalog logic and the raw Hive Metastore machinery.

### A Request's Journey to the Actor

Let's see how a simple request to get a table's metadata is handled by the `HMSCatalogActor`.

1.  A higher-level component, like `HiveCatalog`, needs to load a table.
2.  It calls the `getTable` method on its `HMSCatalogActor` instance.
3.  The `HMSCatalogActor` takes over, finds a ready-to-use connection to the HMS, sends the request, gets the result, and returns it.

This clear separation of concerns means the `HiveCatalog` doesn't need to know anything about Thrift, network pools, or HMS internals. It just needs to ask the actor.

### Under the Hood: The `run` Method and Handler Pooling

How does the `HMSCatalogActor` manage connections so efficiently? It uses a **connection pool**. Instead of creating a new connection for every request (which is very slow), it maintains a pool of ready-to-use connections, called `IHMSHandler`s.

The core of this logic is in a private helper method called `run`.

```java
// File: iceberg/rest/HMSCatalogActor.java

// 1. A function that takes a handler and returns a result
@FunctionalInterface
interface Action<R> {
  R execute(IHMSHandler handler) throws TException;
}

// 2. The main execution method
private <R> R run(Action<R> action) throws TException {
  IHMSHandler handler = null;
  try {
    // 3. Borrow a ready-to-use handler from the pool
    handler = handlers.borrowObject();
    // 4. Execute the specific HMS command
    return action.execute(handler);
  } finally {
    if (handler != null) {
      // 5. Return the handler to the pool for reuse
      handlers.returnObject(handler);
    }
  }
}
```

This pattern is like having a team of technicians on standby:
1.  `Action<R>` is the work order. It describes the job to be done (e.g., "get a table").
2.  The `run` method is the foreman who manages the technicians.
3.  `handlers.borrowObject()`: The foreman picks an available technician (`IHMSHandler`) from the break room (the pool).
4.  `action.execute(handler)`: The foreman gives the work order to the technician, who goes and operates the machine.
5.  `handlers.returnObject(handler)`: When the job is done, the technician returns to the break room, ready for the next task.

Now let's see how `getTable` uses this `run` method.

```java
// File: iceberg/rest/HMSCatalogActor.java

@Override
public Table getTable(String databaseName, String tableName) throws TException {
  // Use the run method to execute the specific HMS call
  return run(h -> h.get_table(databaseName, tableName));
}
```
This is beautifully simple! It tells the `run` method, "Here's my work order: when you get a handler `h`, please call the `h.get_table(...)` method on it." All the complex logic of borrowing and returning the handler is completely hidden.

### The Big Picture: From Catalog to Metastore

Let's visualize the entire flow of getting a table.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Catalog as Iceberg HiveCatalog
    participant Actor as HMSCatalogActor
    participant Pool as Handler Pool
    participant HMS as Hive Metastore

    Catalog->>Actor: getTable("db1", "tbl1")
    Actor->>Pool: borrowObject()
    Pool-->>Actor: Returns an IHMSHandler
    Note over Actor: Now has a live connection
    Actor->>HMS: get_table("db1", "tbl1")
    HMS-->>Actor: Returns table object
    Actor->>Pool: returnObject(handler)
    Note over Actor: Connection is now free for others
    Actor-->>Catalog: Returns table object
```

This diagram shows how the `HMSCatalogActor` acts as a crucial middleman. It gets simple requests from the `HiveCatalog`, manages the technical resources (the handler pool), and communicates with the Hive Metastore using its special language.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we met the `HiveActor`, the specialist technician that communicates directly with the Hive Metastore.

We learned that:
-   It **abstracts away the complexity** of the low-level Thrift protocol used by the Hive Metastore.
-   It provides simple, high-level methods like `getTable` and `createTable`.
-   Implementations like `HMSCatalogActor` use a **connection pool** (`IHMSHandler` pool) to efficiently manage network connections and improve performance.
-   It is the final, essential bridge between the Iceberg world and the internal machinery of the Hive Metastore.

Our current setup with a single handler pool works great when our entire service runs as one user. But what if we have a multi-tenant system where different users need to connect to the HMS with their own separate credentials? Our simple pool isn't designed for that. How can we manage multiple sets of connections for multiple tenants?
